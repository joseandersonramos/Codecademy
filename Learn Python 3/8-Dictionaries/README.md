# Off-Platform Project: Abruptly Goblins

In this off-platform project you will be the proprietor of a comic and games store, the Sorcery Society, and you decide to host a game night to play the hot new tabletop RPG Abruptly Goblins! Youâ€™ll be writing your own Python functions and using dictionaries to provide a new service to gaming attendees of your shop.
