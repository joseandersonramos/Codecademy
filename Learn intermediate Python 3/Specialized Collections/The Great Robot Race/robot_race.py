"""
The reason for writing sleep(seconds_between_turns - time() % seconds_between_turns)
instead of just sleep(seconds_between_turns) in the provided code snippet is to ensure 
that the program waits for the exact time interval specified by seconds_between_turns
without accumulating any additional delay. By subtracting the remainder of the current
time divided by seconds_between_turns, the code accounts for any time that has already 
passed within the current interval and ensures that the next action occurs precisely 
after the specified time interval.
This approach helps maintain a consistent time interval between actions in the program,
preventing any drift that might occur if the program simply waited for seconds_between_turns
without considering the time already elapsed within the current interval.
