# HTML

## HTML Elements

### Attributes

*Attributes* are name-value pairs used to provide additional information about elements. They are placed in the opening tag of the elements.

```HTML
<div id="intro">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
```

### `<span></span>`

`<span>` contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.

```HTML
<p>
    <span>Self-driving cars</span> are anticipated to 
    replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.
</p>
```

### Styling Text

The `<em>` tag emphasizes text, while the `<strong>` tag highlights important text.

```HTML
<p>
    <strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, 
    measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).
</p>
```

“The Nile River” is **bolded** and “longest” is in _italics_.

## HTML Structures

### `<!DOCTYPE html>`

Declaration that tells the browser the type of document to expect and the version of HTML. In this case HTML5.

### `<html></html>`

This tag is used to define the root element of an HTML document. It represents the entire HTML document and contains all other HTML elements.

### `<head></head>`

The `<head>` element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page like the tab title. It goes above the `<body>` element.
